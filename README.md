# United States Inflation Calculator
If you don't have Python, please get it. It not only is a great programming language, and it is required for this program to work. You can download python [here](https://www.python.org/).
This is an open source python inflation calculator for the United States that goes back to 1800 with accurate Goverment Data.
Before you download the program you will need to install the python library "pandas" using a tool called pip, which comes with python. 

### For Windows:
*pip install pandas*

### For Mac:
*pip3 install pandas*

### For Linux:
*sudo apt update && pip3 install pandas*

This is the only library you will need. The inflation data is already added, so it does not need an internet data. This data goes back to the year 1800. I will update it to the each december.
