# United States Inflation Calculator
If you don't have Python, please get it. It not only is a great programming language, but it is required for this program to work. This is an open source python inflation calculator for the United States that goes back to 1800 with accurate Goverment Data
before you download the program, run the command in command prompt:
*pip install pandas*
This is the only library you will need. The inflation data is already added, and it goes back to the year 1800. I will update it to the next year each december.

It is a simple download and run python script. No install or special tools (besides python and pandas) required.

**The Data from 1800 to 1912 is an approximate from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. You can find all the data here:**
